# 🚨 Railway PORT Issue - SOLVED

## The Problem
Railway was not providing the PORT environment variable, causing the app to default to port 3000, which resulted in "EADDRINUSE" errors.

## The Solution

### 1. ✅ Fixed in Latest Commit
The following changes have been pushed to fix the issue:

- **Removed hardcoded NODE_ENV** from package.json start script
- **Improved PORT detection** with better error handling
- **Added debug logging** to see what Railway provides
- **Updated railway.toml** with explicit configuration

### 2. 🔍 Check Railway Settings

**IMPORTANT**: In your Railway project, ensure:

1. **Go to your Railway project dashboard**
2. **Click on your service**
3. **Go to Settings tab**
4. **Scroll down to "Networking"**
5. **Make sure "Generate Domain" is enabled** (this triggers PORT allocation)

### 3. 📝 What the Logs Should Show

After the fix, your Railway logs should display:
```
🔍 Port from ENV: "5432" (parsed as: 5432)  // Railway's assigned port
✅ Server is running on port 5432
```

NOT:
```
🔍 Port from ENV: "" (parsed as: 3000)  // Wrong - using default
```

### 4. 🛠️ Manual Fix (if needed)

If Railway still doesn't provide PORT automatically, you can manually set it:

1. Go to Railway Variables tab
2. Add a new variable:
   ```
   PORT = ${{RAILWAY_TCP_PROXY_PORT}}
   ```
   or
   ```
   PORT = ${{PORT}}
   ```

### 5. 🧪 Test Environment Variables

I've added a test script. You can run it in Railway to check variables:
```bash
node test-env.js
```

This will show all Railway environment variables.

### 6. 🔄 Alternative Start Commands

If issues persist, try these alternative start commands in railway.toml:

```toml
# Option 1: Direct execution
startCommand = "bun run src/index.ts"

# Option 2: Using npm scripts
startCommand = "bun start"

# Option 3: With explicit port binding
startCommand = "bun run src/index.ts --port $PORT"
```

### 7. ✅ Verification Steps

After deployment:
1. Check Railway logs for port detection
2. Ensure no "EADDRINUSE" errors
3. Visit your Railway domain
4. Check `/swagger` endpoint

### 8. 🚀 Current Status

The latest code has been pushed with all fixes. Railway should:
1. Auto-detect the changes
2. Rebuild the application
3. Start successfully with Railway's assigned PORT

## 💡 Key Points

- **Railway assigns dynamic ports** - never hardcode them
- **The PORT environment variable is REQUIRED** for Railway
- **Always use `0.0.0.0` as hostname** for cloud deployments
- **Generate a domain in Railway** to trigger proper networking setup

## 🎯 Success Indicators

Your app is working when:
- ✅ No "Port 3000 in use" errors
- ✅ Logs show Railway's assigned port (not 3000)
- ✅ Can access `https://your-app.railway.app`
- ✅ Swagger works at `/swagger`

If issues persist after these fixes, check:
1. Railway service logs
2. Railway Variables tab
3. Railway Settings → Networking section

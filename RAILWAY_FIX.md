# Railway Deployment Fix

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The "Port 3000 in use" error on Railway has been fixed. The issue was caused by:

1. **PORT Environment Variable**: Railway provides a dynamic PORT, but it wasn't being parsed as a number
2. **Dotenv in Production**: The app was trying to load .env file in production

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed PORT Parsing
```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// After (correct)
const port = Number(process.env.PORT) || 3000;
```

### 2. Disabled Dotenv in Production
```typescript
// Only load .env in development
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  dotenv.config();
}
```

### 3. Updated Start Script
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "NODE_ENV=production bun run src/index.ts"
}
```

## 🚀 Deploy the Fix

1. **Push Changes to GitHub**
```bash
git push origin main
```

2. **Railway will Auto-Deploy**
- Railway automatically detects the push
- Deployment should complete in 1-2 minutes
- Check logs in Railway dashboard

## ✅ Verify Deployment

After deployment, check Railway logs. You should see:
```
🔍 Environment: NODE_ENV=production
🔍 Port from ENV: [Railway's assigned port] (parsed as: [number])
✅ Connected to MongoDB Atlas via Mongoose
✅ Database connected successfully
🚀 Server is running on port [Railway's port]
```

## 🔍 Additional Debugging

If issues persist, check:

1. **Railway Variables Tab**
   - Ensure `MONGODB_URI` is set
   - Railway automatically provides `PORT`

2. **MongoDB Atlas Network Access**
   - Must have `0.0.0.0/0` (Allow from anywhere)
   - Or add Railway's IP ranges

3. **Railway Logs**
   - Check for any error messages
   - Look for the debug output we added

## 📝 Common Railway Environment Variables

Railway automatically provides:
- `PORT` - The port your app must listen on
- `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` - Your app's public URL
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production" by default

## 🎉 Success Indicators

Your app is working when:
- No "EADDRINUSE" errors in logs
- Server shows "running on port" message
- You can access `https://your-app.railway.app/`
- Swagger works at `https://your-app.railway.app/swagger`
